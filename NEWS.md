# echarts4r 0.3.0.9000

Bumped echarts JavaScript library to `4.6.0`, [PR #121](https://github.com/JohnCoene/echarts4r/pull/121), also bumped echarts gl to `1.2.1`.

Every function that adds a serie to chart (e.g.: `e_bar`) have been turned into methods that now can be applied to proxies (`echarts4rProxy`), see the [development vignette](https://echarts4r.john-coene.com/articles/development.html) for more. This implies some minute changes to the `echarts4rProxy`: nothing broken though.

- Warning in `e_axis_fomatter` if user uses RStudio, relates to [#100](https://github.com/JohnCoene/echarts4r/issues/100)
- Fixed [#98](https://github.com/JohnCoene/echarts4r/issues/98) where a bug was introduced in `e_radar_opts` when the timeline component was added.
- `bind` argument added to `e_heatmap`
- `e_scatter_3d` correctly takes `bind` argument when `coords` is set to `cartesian3D` (previously incorrect).
- Bumped number of built-in themes to 40+.
- Added `e_remove_serie_p` to remove series from the graph.
- Added `e_axis_labels` to easily place axis labels.
- Added `e_resize` to dynamically resize the chart.
- Added `e_map_register_p` works like a proxy but does not require a chart.
- Fixed a few issues with `e_mark*` family, labels and multiple marks correctly work.
- Initialisation function now take `reorder` argument to specify whether to reorder numeric values. [#126](https://github.com/JohnCoene/echarts4r/issues/126)
- Added `e_register_theme` to register a global theme, see [#127](https://github.com/JohnCoene/echarts4r/issues/127).
- `e_theme_custom` now accepts path to a JSON file.
- `e_visual_map` drops `NA`s.
- Added `e_axis_stagger` function to stagger x axis labels.

# echarts4r 0.2.3

- Bar chart's `bind` argument has been fixed.
- `e_tooltip_choro_formatter` tooltip formatter for choropleth maps added, thanks to [Artem](https://github.com/artemklevtsov).
- Tooltip formatters correctly identify locale on UNIX systems, thanks to [Artem](https://github.com/artemklevtsov).
- `e_mark_point()`, `e_mark_line()` and `e_mark_area()` no longer use `grep()`, which means the serie will only be matched with the exact same name. Thanks @shrektan for the reporting and PR (#80, #81).
- Multiple `e_title` now allowed.
- Multiple `e_visual_map` in [timelines](https://echarts4r.john-coene.com/articles/timeline.html) is now fixed.
- Corrected all links (or so I think).
- `e_sankey` fix thanks to [Artem Klevtsov](https://github.com/artemklevtsov).

# echarts4r 0.2.2

- `e_draw_p` added to choose draw chart.
- `e_inspect` to inspect the output of echarts4r.
- `echarts_from_json` to create an echarts4r object from JSON options.
- `e_axis` family of functions (e.g.: `e_x_axis`) now accepts a column name as first argument to easily adapt the range of the axes, in a similar fashion as with `e_visual_map`.
- `e_charts` family forces data.frame conversion to avoid jsonlite bug.
- Fixed bug in the `formatter` argument of `e_tooltip` where passing custom function was not working.

# echarts4r 0.2.0

Arguments containing `.` have been replaced by `_` for clarity. I.e.: `coord.system` => `coord_system`.
